//! Token repository implementation placeholder
//! 
//! This module provides a placeholder for the concrete implementation
//! which is actually located in the infrastructure layer.
//! This separation maintains clean architecture boundaries between
//! the domain/business logic and infrastructure concerns.

// The actual implementation (MySqlTokenRepository) is in the infrastructure layer
// at server/infrastructure/src/database/mysql/token_repository_impl.rs
// This allows the core domain to remain independent of specific database technologies.

// Placeholder struct for compilation purposes
// Will be replaced with actual implementation from infrastructure layer
pub struct MySqlTokenRepository;
