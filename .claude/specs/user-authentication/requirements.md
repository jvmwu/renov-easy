# Requirements Document - User Authentication

## Introduction

The User Authentication feature provides secure access control for the RenovEasy platform, enabling users to sign up and log in using phone number verification with SMS, social authentication providers, and user type selection. This feature serves as the gateway to all platform functionalities, ensuring proper user identification and access control for both customers seeking renovation services and workers providing those services.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This authentication feature directly supports the RenovEasy product vision by:
- **Facilitating seamless marketplace access**: Providing quick and secure entry points for both homeowners and renovation workers
- **Building trust**: Phone verification ensures real user identities, crucial for a service marketplace
- **Supporting bilingual users**: Authentication flows support both Chinese and English languages
- **Enabling user segmentation**: Distinguishing between customers and workers to provide tailored experiences
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Authentication works seamlessly across iOS, Android, and HarmonyOS

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Phone Number Authentication

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up using my phone number, so that I can quickly create an account without remembering passwords

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid phone number THEN the system SHALL send an SMS verification code within 60 seconds
2. IF the phone number format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message immediately
3. WHEN a user enters the correct verification code THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and proceed to user type selection (for new users) or home screen (for existing users)
4. IF the verification code is incorrect THEN the system SHALL display an error and allow retry up to 3 times
5. WHEN the verification code expires (after 5 minutes) THEN the system SHALL require the user to request a new code

### Requirement 2: Social Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using my existing Apple/Google/Facebook account, so that I can access the platform without creating a new account

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects social authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate OAuth provider
2. IF the social authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create or link the user account
3. WHEN a new user signs in via social auth THEN the system SHALL prompt for user type selection
4. IF the social authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error and offer alternative sign-in methods
5. WHEN a user cancels social authentication THEN the system SHALL return to the authentication selection screen

### Requirement 3: User Type Selection

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to select whether I'm a customer or worker, so that I receive the appropriate interface and features

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL present user type selection options
2. IF the user selects "Customer" THEN the system SHALL configure the account for customer features and redirect to customer home
3. IF the user selects "Worker" THEN the system SHALL configure the account for worker features and prompt for professional verification
4. WHEN a worker account is created THEN the system SHALL require professional certification upload within 30 days
5. IF no user type is selected THEN the system SHALL not allow progression until a selection is made

### Requirement 4: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist securely, so that I don't need to log in repeatedly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token valid for 30 days
2. IF the session token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all session tokens for that user
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication
5. WHEN a user changes authentication methods THEN the system SHALL maintain account continuity

### Requirement 5: Multi-Platform Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the same account across different devices and platforms, so that I have a consistent experience

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in on a new device THEN the system SHALL sync their account data and preferences
2. IF a user switches between iOS, Android, and HarmonyOS THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent authentication state
3. WHEN authentication occurs on one device THEN the system SHALL optionally notify other logged-in devices
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL maintain cached authentication state for offline access to basic features

### Requirement 6: Internationalization

**User Story:** As a bilingual user, I want to see authentication screens in my preferred language, so that I can understand the process clearly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects system language as Chinese THEN the system SHALL display authentication UI in Chinese
2. IF the user manually selects English THEN the system SHALL display authentication UI in English
3. WHEN SMS verification is sent THEN the system SHALL send messages in the user's selected language
4. IF language preference changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update all authentication-related text

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- SMS verification codes must be single-use and expire after 5 minutes
- Social authentication must use OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- Passwords (if implemented later) must be hashed using Argon2

### Reliability
- Authentication service must maintain 99.9% uptime
- SMS delivery must have fallback providers for redundancy
- Social authentication must gracefully handle provider outages
- System must handle concurrent authentication requests from 10,000 users
- Database must support authentication data replication for disaster recovery

### Usability
